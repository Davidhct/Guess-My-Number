### Summary

The Guess-My-Number game app is a single page application (SPA) that the user aims to guess which number the program has issued.<br>
If the user guessed a larger number than what came out, then he gets a "too high" hint, if the user entered a smaller number than what came out, then he gets a "too low" hint.<br>
And if the user guessed right then he won the game.
Plus if the user has not guessed well in all 20 guesses he has then he has lost.
